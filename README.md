This is a fork of https://github.com/subhan-nadeem/bitcoin-mining-python.

New:
My version mines blocks and saves them. After a program restar, it mines forwards.
You have (normally) a space of 64 * 29 places, where you can put in something. (2 ^ what you want - 48).
This is a simple blockchain system. It generates blocks with the nonce, the hash of the last block and your custom data (you can change it in the var "cd").
